## Description

This portfolio site was based on the formatting of resumes and consists of two pages: the homepage and the about. It could have been a single page, which would require a reworking of the navigation, but content for this portfolio was split between personal and impersonal information. The homepage provides the impersonal, consisting of a projects gallery, education, experience, and a personal statement on reasons for taking a programming class, or rather training. In contrast, the about provides the personal, consisting of interests, hobbies, skills and contact details.
